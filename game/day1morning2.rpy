    "You two continue your conversation until you reach the school. You split up as you head to the second year classroom, and Kaito heads up to the third year classrooms."
    "When you get there, you remember that you and Kaito left for school earlier than usual. The classroom is near empty…"
    "Except for a certain someone sitting in his seat."

    "Nick looks up at you and seems genuinely surprised. "
    "What’s that…? Did he blush just now? "
    "In that brief moment, he quickly looks back down at his desk again, trying to look bored."
    n "...Hey."
    "You drop your stuff on your desk, which is in front of his, and swing around in your seat to turn and face him."
    l "Whatcha doin’? Are you always here so early?"
    "Nick just nods."
    n "Yeah… This is normal for me."
    l "Well, this is sooo early for me! I’m not use to this!"
    n "Why are you here then?"
    l "Ehh, I usually walk to school with my friend and he dragged me along."

    n "Hmph… it’s none of my concern."
    l "Aw, don’t be like that~"
    "The conversation continued on like in the early hours of the morning. To others, your borderline flirting and his hot-and-cold behavior might seem weird, but this was a normal conversation between you two."
    "Initially, Nick was a lot more withdrawn from you and… well, everyone."
    "You didn’t often see him really hanging out with anyone, especially when he first transferred in at the beginning of the semester."
    "Due to his mysterious nature, K-pop boy band member build, and superior jaw structure, you felt immediately drawn to him."
    "Perhaps it was your maternal instinct kicking it, but you felt the need to be by his side and make sure he was okay."
    "Sure enough, you had begun to develop feelings for him, and confessed… Yet…"

    "And it worked… A little too well, in fact."
    "Now he took every chance to impress you with his Kermit the Frog impressions, racist accents, and telling you what a nice guy he is."
    "Fortunately, you've been able to fend off most of his advances."
    "In fact, thanks to him, you were able to hold onto Nick’s shoulder tightly the whole time!"

    m "PFFFFT, you two have secretly flirting since childhood."
    l "Whaaaat, no. We grew up together!!!"
    m "Yeah you also grew up with Bao, and I can see a big difference!"
    "You don’t know what to say. "
    "You’re a mix of happy and flustered when you think about the guys you have a crush on liking you back, but at the same time can’t help but wonder why nothing has come to fruition between the two."
    m "You should make a move before the bonfire dance after the Culture Festival. It’s the perfect chance!!"

    l "Yeah!!"
