    "You remember you and Kaito use to spend the afternoons together, eating ice cream in the warm sun."   
    "Later, the sky was a dusky, scarlet red as you both walked hand-in-hand together. "
    "Kaito was all aglow and smiled adoringly at you."

    l "Of course, we will! I love you, Kaito-nii-kun!!!!"
    k "I love you too, Liz-chan!"
    "You remember you both giggled, smiled at one another, and he leaned over and placed a loving kiss on your cheek."
    "As time passed, more adults around you would tease how inseparable you two were. "
    "You started spending time apart for other reasons, but still walk together to and from school everyday. "
    "At some point, you wondered if Kaito had forgotten that conversation from a long time ago because he gradually began to refer to you more and more of a sister."
    "But, still... He always stayed close by your side to comfort and protect you in your worst moments."
    "Just the thought of him made you feel warm and protected, like a blanket on a cold day…"

    "???" "Fang-san…"
    l "Mmm..?"
    "???" "Fang-san… you have drool on your mouth."
