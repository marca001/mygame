    "You and Myca help move the props around the room. The class representative was generally in charge, rushing around and making sure people were on top of their assigned tasks."
    "However, while he was in charge, a lot of the ideas that everyone was now working on had initially come from Nick."
    "His often unheard voice quietly spoke up during the first few brainstorm sessions of the project. "
    "Now, he had gradually become more involved and notably less shy when he was focused on his work."
    l "Nee, Nick-san, you’re so talented! Most of the stuff we’re working on was your idea!"

    n "...Not really."
        
    l "Whoa, you’re already done with most of the props you started with…"
    l "If you’re done already, help me with mine! It’s heavy~"

    m "Huh? You carried my prop AND yours."
    l "Whaaaat? No, I didn’t. "
    l "Shouldn’t you work on yours?! Hmm?!"
    "You turn and look at Myca with a shut-your-mouth smile."

    m "Ooh.. OHHhh. YEAH. Yes."
    "Myca suppresses a shit eating grin and continues working on her prop, which was a ghost. "

    "Occasionally you could hear her the background going, \"Spoooopy, so spoooopy!\""
    l "But, yeah!"
    "You flip your hair back dramatically, making sure your eyes flutter as you speak again."
    l "I’m sooo lost, I don’t even know what to do with my prop."

    n "...Um, wasn’t it explained to everyone earlier what to do?"
    l "Was it? Umm, maybe I wasn’t there.. I think I was texting Myca…"
    l "(...even though she was sitting next to me…)"
    l "Can you show me again? You’re doing such a good job already!"
    "Nick looks away, his mouth in a tight line. Yet he didn’t seem unhappy."
    n "Jeez, it’s not that good… It’s just like anybody else’s… B-baka!"
    "You can’t help but smile at his embarrassment."
    l "No, really, you have a knack for this! Will you help me?"
    n "I guess…"
    "Nick moves to your side of the room as he shows you what to do. Well, you kind of already knew, but you still thank him every step of the way. You spend your time working together on the cardboard pieces, gradually transforming them into somewhat scary pieces for a Haunted House."
#    "The sun has set considerably more, turning the classroom orange and red. You hardly notice because you’re caught up casually talking with Nick about the upcoming festival, your love for arts-and-crafty things, probing him for his own experience which he shyly opens up about."
#    "You finish another prop together, looking at it proudly. It’s a tree that looks really mad and has sharp teeth. Okay, well, maybe it looks more cute than scary, but whatever! You’re sure they’ll use some lighting trick to make it look truly horrifying.."
#    l "Okay, let’s do another one. I need this, right?"
#    n "Actually for this part, you’ll need this glue… Here."
#    "He hands you the bottle of glue, but just as you take it, it slips out of your fingers and falls to the ground. Oops!"
#    "However, you and Nick both reach down at the same time and your hands bump together. The brief touch of his warm slender fingers causes sparks in your kokoro."
#    l "Kya! Oh, I’m sorry, I’m so clumsy…"
#    n "I-it’s fine, it’s no big deal…"
#    "Nick tries to hide it, but he is blushing as much as you. The gluestick is still on the floor. You both reach down at the same time again, but freeze up again, babble at each other a bit more, until finally you swiftly pick the bottle up off the ground."
#    l "l’ve got it! Hahaha.. ha."
#    n "Yeah…"
#    "There’s a brief awkward silence between you. You look desperately around the classroom to see if any other classmates saw the little spectacle, not sure what to do with yourself."
#    "To your surprise most people are gone, even Myca. "
#    l "Uh, where’d Myca go?"
#    n "She left a while ago… Don’t you remember?"
#    l "She did!? I didn’t even notice!"
#    n "Apparently. She even told you she was leaving…"
#    l "Oh, I guess so… Wow, it’s actually getting pretty late."
#    n "...Yep. I think I’m gonna go…"
#    l "Aww, no, I was enjoying this too!"
#    n "Really?"
#    l "Yeah, like they say, time passes when you’re having fun!"
#    n "Huh… I thought you’d find this kind of boring."
#    l "Teehee! No way! I think it’s because I’m with you."
#    "It’s hard to tell from the dimming classroom, but Nick definitely turned quite a few shades redder."
#    n "That’s stupid… Fine, let’s work on just one more."
#    l "Yay!"
#    "You cheer loudly with that bottle in your hand. Nick scolds you not to drop it again and you quickly make yourself serious again. After using the glue and a few markers, you can’t help but glow at your progress."
#    "Absent mindedly, you reach for the box cutter for the next step. Without warning, you feel a sharp pain on the palm of your hand. "
#    l "Ouch!"
#    n "What’s wrong?"
#    "You look down and see a cut on your hand, blood smeared around it. It’s only a mild sting, but Nick already has grabbed your hand and is looking at the small cut in silent horror."
#    n "Liz…!"
#    l "Er.. sorry! Don’t worry, it’s only a c--"
#    n "Don’t move your hand!"
#    "Nick already has rushed over with a first aid kit."
#    l "Wow, where did that come from?"
#    "Without prompt, he takes your injured hand in his and is already wiping away the blood. Despite his earlier reaction when you two brushed hands, he is moving with quiet precision this time."
#    n "I brought it, of course. We’re working with tools here, of course I have to be prepared."
#    l "Oh…"
#    "You feel slightly ashamed at your carelessness but at the same time, can’t help but blush. You can tell Nick is really worried about you, and you’re happy to see him suddenly take you so seriously."
#    "As you think this, he meticulously applies alcohol to a cotton swab and press down on the cut. You hiss at the sharp pain again."
#    "Nick looks up at you again, clearly feeling bad. But, then he looks down and his eyes turn stern again."
#    n "You have to be more careful! You can’t be so reckless!"
#    l "S-sorry… I wasn’t paying attention."
#    "You look to the side, feeling guilty. Holding your hand again, Nick finally applies a bandaid."
#    l "Well, it doesn’t hurt anymore… Thank you for taking care of me."
#    "Nick softens for a second, but you can tell he’s trying to stay miffed for some reason."
#    n "It’s nothing… Next time, just pay attention!"
#    l "I will, I will… I’ll try not to be such a burden. I see why you don’t like me back…"
#    n "...! That’s not true at all, I never said that..."
#    "You can feel Nick’s hand squeeze yours tighter. You look down and see he’s holding your small hand between his still."
#    n "If anything, I don’t understand why you’re still so nice to me…!"
#    l "U-um, Nick-kun, your hand…"
#    "Nick looks down and quickly pulls his hands away from you in embarrassment."
#    l "And of course I’m still nice to you… Even though you didn’t respond to my confessions, I can’t help it."
#    "Unconsciously, you smile sadly. "
#    l "I guess I really am an idiot, huh? I really should move on."
#    "Nick clenches his fists and looks away from you."
#    n "Look, I never said no, okay? I’m just.. I don’t know what I want… I-I have to go, okay?"
#    "He quickly grabs his bag and hurriedly leaves the classroom."
#    "You sit there with your thoughts, thinking about what happened. You had confessed your feelings to him before, but he never said anything, so you took it as a rejection. But, he seemed keen on making it clear that he hasn’t turned you down yet."
#    "That combined with all his flustered reactions gives you hope that maybe he really does like you back. You can feel the butterflies in your stomach fluttering all over again, but at the same time your brain is telling you to be rational."
#        "You put your hands up against your face, squeezing your cheeks as all these thoughts race through your head."
#        l "Nick-kun…! Could he really like me…?"
#        "Bao" "wut?"
#        "You look up and see one of your long time friends. He is okay looking."
#        l "Oh! N-nothing! I gotta go!"
#        "Bao" "Wait, what about all the cleanup? We gotta move all this stuff before we go!"
#        l "Oooh, could you take care of it for me? I reaaally gotta go, I might get in trouble. Okay bye!"
#        "Bao" "Really? REALLY?"
#    "Later when you get home, you’re thrown back into your normal household duties."
#    "You help with dinner, have dinner with your 20 million siblings who are all like 10, and help clean up."
    "The whole time, though, you’re thinking about what just happened. The bet, the way that Nick had acted in the afternoon, everything…"
