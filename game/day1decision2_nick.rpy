    "You and Myca help move the props around the room."
    "The class representative was generally in charge, rushing around and making sure people were on top of their assigned tasks."
    "However, while he was in charge, a lot of the ideas that everyone was now working on had initially come from Nick."
    "His often unheard voice quietly spoke up during the first few brainstorm sessions of the project. "
    "Now, he had gradually become more involved and notably less shy when he was focused on his work."
    l "Nee, Nick-san, you’re so talented! Most of the stuff we’re working on was your idea!"

    "...Well, you kind of already knew, but you still thank him every step of the way. "
    "You spend your time working together on the cardboard pieces, gradually transforming them into somewhat scary pieces for a Haunted House."
    "You finish another prop together, looking at it proudly. It’s a tree that looks really mad and has sharp teeth. "
    "Okay, well, maybe it looks more cute than scary, but whatever! You’re sure they’ll use some lighting trick to make it look truly horrifying."
    l "Okay, let’s do another one. I need this, right?"

    n "Actually for this part, you’ll need this glue… Here."
    "He hands you the bottle of glue, but just as you take it, it slips out of your fingers and falls to the ground."
    "Oops!"
    "However, you and Nick both reach down at the same time and your hands bump together. "

    "You both reach down at the same time again, but freeze up again, babble at each other a bit more, until finally you swiftly pick the bottle up off the ground."
    l "l’ve got it! Hahaha.. ha."
    n "Yeah…"
    "There’s a brief awkward silence between you. "
    "You look desperately around the classroom to see if any other classmates saw the little spectacle, not sure what to do with yourself."
    "To your surprise, most people are gone, even Myca. "
    l "Uh, where’d Myca go?"

    "After using the glue and a few markers, you can’t help but glow at your progress."
    "Absent mindedly, you reach for the box cutter for the next step. "

    "Without prompt, he takes your injured hand in his and is already wiping away the blood. "
    "Despite his earlier reaction when you two brushed hands, he is moving with quiet precision this time."
    n "I brought it, of course. We’re working with tools here so I have to be prepared."
    l "Oh…"
    "You feel slightly ashamed at your carelessness but at the same time, can’t help but blush. "
    "You can tell Nick is really worried about you, and you’re happy to see him suddenly take you so seriously."
    "As you think this, he meticulously applies alcohol to a cotton swab and presses down on the cut."

    l "Nick-kun..."
    "The truth was that you had confessed your feelings to him a couple of weeks ago... but he never said anything back."
    "So, of course you couldn't help but take it as rejection. "
    "On the other hand, his behavior today and what he had just said..."
    "He seemed keen on making it clear that he hasn’t turned you down yet."
    "Perhaps he really does like you back...?"
    "You can feel the butterflies in your stomach fluttering all over again, but at the same time your brain is telling you to be rational."
    "You put your hands up against your face, squeezing your cheeks as all these thoughts race through your head."
    l "Nick-kun…! Could he really like me…?"
    "Bao" "wut?"
