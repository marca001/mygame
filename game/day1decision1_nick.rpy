    "Class starts up again and goes by quickly. "
    "You manage to stay awake for most of it, but towards the end of class you find yourself lost in thought again."
    "As the sun sets, you watch a couple of students hurry by holding a sign, probably meant for the Culture Festival."
    "You think about the work you have to do for the festival..."
    "...and can't help but think of Nick."

    "Despite his distant attitude toward other students, he was actually contributing a lot more than expected to their class project. "
    "He had come a long way compared to when he first transferred in. "
    "You remember the teacher introducing him to the class and him mumbling his introduction."
    "The other students avoided him for the most part after that. He was definitely a loner."
    "That didn’t stop you, though. "
    "You found yourself drawn into him and his manly jaw structure right away and his mysterious cold attitude."
    "Everyday, you would bother him just to exchange pleasantries. It became almost a goal at that point just to see him crack a smile."
    "One day, he mentioned casually about his ability to use a bow."
    "Your eyes nearly bulged from it’s sockets in disbelief at the idea of something so cool."
    l "WHAT?!? So you can, like, shoot an ARROW?? From a BOW???" with vpunch
    "Unexpectedly, he looked away from you trying to suppress a grin and letting some chuckles through."
    l "Eh!? What’s so funny!?"
    n "Your expression… You just look so shocked..."
    l "B-but, that's so COOL! Don’t make fun of me!!"
    "When Nick had composed himself again, he turned and looked at you with the first real smile you’d ever seen on his face."
    n "Thanks… You’re funny… "
    n "I feel like I haven’t smiled in a while."
    "You could feel your heart going doki-doki…"
    "It was then you realized that you loved him for more than his jaw structure."
    "…"
    "???" "Fang-san…"
    l "Mmm..?"
    "???" "Fang-san… you have drool on your mouth."
